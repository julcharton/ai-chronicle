      "taskTitle": "Setup Project Foundation with Next.js",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Next.js project setup into specific subtasks covering: 1) Next.js App Router initialization, 2) PostgreSQL/Drizzle integration, 3) OpenAI API configuration, 4) Authentication flow implementation, and 5) Project structure organization. For each subtask, include specific files to create and dependencies to install.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple technologies (Next.js, PostgreSQL, Prisma, OpenAI) and requires setting up the foundation for the entire application. The complexity comes from integrating these different systems and ensuring they work together properly."

      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Core Data Models",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the core data model implementation in lib/db/schema.ts into subtasks covering: 1) Implement the core database models for Postscrypt, a memory preservation platform using Editor.js. Each memory is composed of rich, block-based content stored as JSON in a blocks field. Users have roles (preserver, descendant, historian, admin) and one canonical timeline. Implement the following tables in PostgreSQL: (1) users: update exiting table, created_at/updated_at; (2) memories: UUID, FK to users, title, occurred_at, visibility, source, blocks (JSONB), tags (JSONB), timestamps; (3) media: FK to memory, file_url, type (image/audio/video), caption; (4) family_links: from_user/to_user, relationship type (e.g., parent/spouse);  No need for a separate memory_blocks table, as Editor.js handles structured input. Enforce referential integrity with ON DELETE CASCADE. 2) Drizzle schema creation with proper relationships, 3) Database migration setup, 4) CRUD operations implementation, and 5) Relationship validation and testing. Include specific field definitions and relationship types.",
      "reasoning": "Creating the data models requires careful planning of relationships between entities and implementing proper CRUD operations. The complexity is moderate as it involves database schema design, migrations, and TypeScript interfaces."

Include prompt templates and component structure details.",
      "reasoning": "This task combines UI development with complex AI integration. It requires sophisticated prompt engineering, voice transcription, and a responsive UI that can adapt to user responses. The conversational nature adds significant complexity."

      "taskTitle": "Build Auto-Organized Timeline View",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the auto-organized timeline view into subtasks covering: 1) Timeline component with decade-based segments, 2) NLP date/event extraction implementation, 3) AI summary generation for memories, 4) Progressive decade loading mechanism, 5) API endpoint for year-based memory retrieval, and 6) Time-travel navigation UI. Include specific NLP techniques and rendering approaches.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves complex UI rendering, NLP for date extraction, and AI for generating summaries. The progressive loading and decade-based organization add technical challenges, making this a high-complexity task."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Memory Vault Storage",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the memory vault storage implementation into subtasks covering: 1) S3 integration for 50GB/user storage, 2) Media handling for different file types, 3) AI auto-tagging system, 4) Media processing for voice/photo/video, 5) Privacy controls with Memory Lock feature, 6) E2E encryption implementation, and 7) Storage quota management. Include security considerations and media processing techniques.",
      "reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to the variety of media types, security requirements (E2E encryption), and AI-based auto-tagging. Handling different media formats and implementing proper security measures requires significant technical expertise."

Include vector database selection and embedding strategy details.",
      "reasoning": "Implementing a RAG system is highly complex, requiring vector embeddings, sophisticated retrieval mechanisms, and careful prompt engineering. The ethical boundaries and contextual retrieval add additional layers of complexity."

Include UI component structure and relationship data model details.",
      "reasoning": "This task combines UI challenges (drag-and-drop interface) with data modeling for family relationships. The permission controls add complexity, though it builds on existing data models which reduces the overall complexity somewhat."
