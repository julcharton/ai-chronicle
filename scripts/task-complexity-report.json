    {
      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Setup Project Repository with Next.js App Router",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Next.js App Router project setup into specific technical steps including repository initialization, Next.js configuration, database connection setup, environment configuration, and dependency management.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves several distinct technical steps that are moderately complex. Setting up Next.js with App Router requires specific configuration, and integrating Prisma with PostgreSQL adds additional complexity. The task is foundational but follows established patterns."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Core Data Models and Database Schema",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the specific steps for implementing the database schema, including defining Document and Chat interfaces, creating Prisma models, setting up relationships, implementing migrations, and ensuring proper typing throughout the application.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires careful data modeling and understanding of relationships between entities. Setting up proper database schemas with migrations and typing requires attention to detail. The 1:1 relationship between documents and chats adds complexity to the data model design."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Memory List Management Interface",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the memory list interface implementation into UI components, data fetching logic, search functionality, filtering mechanisms, pagination implementation, and responsive design considerations.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves both frontend and backend work with multiple interactive features. Implementing search, filtering, sorting, and pagination requires careful state management and API design. The responsive design requirements add another layer of complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Build Markdown Document Editor with Floating Menu",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps for implementing a markdown editor by adapting existing code, including floating menu implementation, formatting options, auto-save functionality, state management, keyboard shortcuts, and responsive design considerations.",
      "reasoning": "Implementing a rich text editor with floating menus is inherently complex. This task requires modifying existing code, implementing real-time formatting features, managing document state, and ensuring proper auto-save functionality. The combination of UI complexity and state management makes this challenging."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Image Upload and Integration",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the image upload feature into API endpoint creation, frontend integration, image processing logic, storage implementation, error handling, and UI integration with the markdown editor.",
      "reasoning": "Image handling involves both frontend and backend work with security considerations. The task requires file validation, API endpoint creation, storage management, and integration with the editor. Image optimization and error handling add additional complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Develop AI Chat Interface for Memory Guidance",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the implementation steps for the AI chat interface, including server adaptation, UI development, prompt engineering for memory elicitation, GPT-4 integration, state management, persistence implementation, and error handling.",
      "reasoning": "This task combines complex UI work with sophisticated AI integration. Creating specialized prompts for memory elicitation requires careful design. The integration with GPT-4 Turbo, maintaining chat history, and ensuring proper error handling all contribute to the high complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Memory Creation Flow",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the memory creation flow into workflow design, UI implementation, state management, AI integration for initial prompting, navigation between interfaces, and error handling components.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires coordinating multiple components (document editor and chat) with complex state management. The flow must handle AI prompting, user interactions, and proper state transitions. Ensuring a smooth user experience across this flow adds significant complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Memory Editing Flow",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps for implementing the memory editing flow, including loading existing documents, maintaining chat context, implementing auto-save, designing the editing UI, and handling errors and recovery.",
      "reasoning": "While similar to the creation flow, this task has additional complexity in loading existing data and maintaining context. The version history or change tracking adds complexity, but it builds on components already developed in previous tasks."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Prompt Security and AI Boundaries",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of AI security measures into system prompt design, template creation for different scenarios, guardrail implementation, content filtering, feedback mechanisms, and monitoring systems.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves sophisticated prompt engineering and security considerations. Creating effective guardrails that limit AI to memory discussions without being too restrictive requires careful design. The content filtering and monitoring systems add significant complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 10,
      "taskTitle": "Implement User Onboarding and Documentation",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps for creating user onboarding, including first-time user flow design, tooltip implementation, help documentation creation, contextual help integration, example content creation, and feedback collection mechanisms.",
      "reasoning": "This task is primarily content and UX focused rather than technically complex. Creating clear documentation and onboarding requires attention to detail and good UX design, but it doesn't involve complex technical challenges compared to other tasks in the project."
