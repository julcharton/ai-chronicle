      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Memories List Page",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Memories List Page implementation into subtasks covering UI components, responsive design, empty state handling, data fetching, and search/filter functionality",
      "reasoning": "This task involves frontend development with multiple UI components, responsive design considerations, and data integration. It's moderately complex due to the need for empty state handling and search/filter capabilities, but has no dependencies."
    },

      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Create Memory Data Models and API Endpoints",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Memory Data Models and API Endpoints task into subtasks covering database schema design, API endpoint implementation, validation logic, repository pattern setup, auto-save functionality, and error handling",
      "reasoning": "This task involves backend architecture with database design, API development, and data validation. The complexity is higher due to the need for implementing a repository pattern and auto-save functionality, plus ensuring proper relationships between models."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Adapt Text Editor for Memory Documents",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Text Editor adaptation task into subtasks covering component refactoring, ProseMirror integration, state synchronization, markdown support, auto-save implementation, and editor-specific UI enhancements",
      "reasoning": "Adapting an existing text editor is highly complex due to the need to maintain current functionality while adding memory-specific features. The ProseMirror integration, state synchronization, and auto-save functionality add significant complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Two-Column Layout",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Two-Column Layout implementation into subtasks covering responsive container design, mobile layout adaptation, component integration, and synchronized scrolling functionality",
      "reasoning": "This task focuses on UI layout with responsive design considerations. The complexity is moderate, involving desktop and mobile layouts, but the core functionality is primarily structural with some technical challenges in synchronized scrolling."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Memory Chat Interface",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Memory Chat Interface development into subtasks covering UI component creation, chat persistence layer, API endpoint implementation, message history display, and AI integration foundation",
      "reasoning": "This task combines frontend and backend work with chat UI development, data persistence, and API implementation. The complexity is elevated by the need to set up the foundation for AI integration and handle message history."
    },

      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Integrate AI Guidance System",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the AI Guidance System integration into subtasks covering Vercel AI integration, prompt template development, contextual question generation, content synchronization, suggestion endpoint implementation, visual indicators, and error handling",
      "reasoning": "This is one of the most complex tasks, involving AI integration, prompt engineering, and bidirectional content synchronization. The need to create contextual questions and ensure AI doesn't fabricate details adds significant complexity."

      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Image Upload and Integration",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Image Upload and Integration task into subtasks covering editor menu extension, upload endpoint implementation, CloudStorage integration, markdown embedding, and image positioning controls",
      "reasoning": "This task involves both frontend and backend work with file handling and storage integration. The complexity is moderate, focusing on extending existing functionality with image capabilities and cloud storage."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Memory Creation Flow",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Memory Creation Flow implementation into subtasks covering initialization logic, two-panel interface setup, AI conversation initiation, real-time updates, state management, and persistence implementation",
      "reasoning": "This task integrates multiple complex components into a cohesive user flow. The complexity is high due to the need for real-time updates between chat and editor, plus AI integration for conversation initiation."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Memory Editing Flow",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Memory Editing Flow implementation into subtasks covering existing memory loading, pre-population of interface, conversation continuation logic, auto-save implementation, and context-aware AI assistance",
      "reasoning": "This task builds on the creation flow but adds complexity for handling existing data and continuing conversations. The context-aware AI assistance based on existing content adds particular complexity."

      "taskId": 10,
      "taskTitle": "Implement UI Polish and Performance Optimization",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the UI Polish and Performance Optimization task into subtasks covering UI refinements, document virtualization, visual mode distinctions, AI cost optimization, error handling/recovery, and loading state implementation",
      "reasoning": "This task involves both aesthetic refinements and technical optimizations across the entire application. The complexity comes from the breadth of concerns (UI, performance, error handling) and the need for optimization for large documents and AI cost efficiency."
