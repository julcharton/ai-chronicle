Great! Going with a **full-screen style layout** means you’ll have a clean, focused experience where users either:

- **capture** a memory via chat,  
- or **browse/view** existing memories via a full-screen timeline.

So let's break this down step by step.

## 🧠 What is a "Memory"?

At its core, **a memory** is a structured, timestamped story. It’s captured in different formats (text, audio, photos, etc.) and enriched with metadata to make it retrievable and organized.

### ✨ Core components of a memory:
| Element              | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `title`              | A short, descriptive summary of the memory (e.g. "Our Wedding Day")         |
| `date`               | When the memory happened (precise or approximate)                           |
| `description`        | The full narrative, possibly first-person (text, AI-generated, or both)     |
| `media`              | Photos, videos, voice recordings (user-uploaded or captured in-app)         |
| `tags`               | Topics (e.g., love, travel), people, locations                               |
| `source`             | How the memory was created (AI chat, manual entry, imported, etc.)          |
| `privacy setting`    | Visibility (private, family only, public)                                   |
| `contributors`       | Who contributed to this memory (e.g., daughter added images later)          |
| `reviewed/verified`  | Optional indicator if a Family Historian has fact-checked or annotated it   |

## 📄 What would 1 memory *look like* in full-screen view?

Think of each memory as a rich, immersive **"story page"**. Here's one suggested layout for desktop:

```
╭────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│ ← Back to Timeline                [✏ Edit] [🔒 Private]     │
╰────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

📅  June 18, 1974                🏷️  Wedding • Family • France

# Our Wedding Day 💍

👤 Told by: Jeanne Dubois    🎙️ Interviewed in 2024 (AI-assisted)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📝 “It was a warm summer morning in Bordeaux. My dress was handmade 
by my aunt, and your grandfather looked so nervous he forgot to bring 
the rings…”

📷 [Photo Carousel of Wedding Pictures]

🎧 [Audio Clip Button: “Listen to Jeanne talk about this moment”]

📍 Location: Bordeaux, France  
👥 People: Jacques Dubois (husband), Aunt Marie, Sister Claire

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

💬 Comments & Reflections:
- ✍️ Added by Sophie Dubois: “You always told this story with a twinkle in your eye.”
- 📌 Verified by Marc Dubois, Family Historian – 2024

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[ 🔁 Ask the AI: "Tell me more about her wedding dress" ]
```

**Design Notes:**
- The layout reads like a blog post or biography excerpt, but enriched with multimedia and metadata.
- Clicking on the **"Ask the AI"** button launches a *chat-with-context* mode about that memory (more below).
- It respects narrative depth, while enabling search, filtering, and AI summarization.

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 How to Access Someone Else’s Memories

There are multiple ways to **navigate into another person’s memory archive**, depending on your access level. Since you’re using a **full-screen interface**, each of these would open its own full-screen view.

### Option A: **From Family Tree or Profile Page**

Imagine you’re viewing the tree and click on *“Grandpa Jacques”*. His **profile page** appears:

```
╭────────────────────────────────────────╮
│ ← Back to Tree         👤 Jacques Dubois │
╰────────────────────────────────────────╯

🧬 Relationship: Grandfather
📅 1925 – 2006
📍 Lived in: Bordeaux, France
🧠 Memories: 42 stories

[ 📖 View Timeline ]   [ 🤖 Talk to Jacques' AI Persona ]
```

You can then:
- Tap **“View Timeline”** → Full-screen timeline of Jacques’ life appears
- Or **“Talk to AI Persona”** → Full-screen chat interface with his AI opens

> When viewing someone else’s timeline, you can scroll through their memories just like your own — but the "Add Memory" option may be hidden or restricted (depending on permissions).

---

### Option B: **Search + Browse**

A **global search bar** lets you look for people, events, or themes.

Typing: `"Grandpa Jacques wedding"`  
→ shows a list of matching memories  
→ click one → opens full-screen memory page (as described earlier)

---

### Option C: **Shared Link or Invitation**

If a family member shares a **public or family-visible memory**, it opens like this:

> 📬 You receive a link: `postscrypt.app/memory/jacques-1974-wedding`

You’re taken directly to the **memory’s full-screen display**, complete with:

- Timeline marker (e.g., “Life Chapter: The Early Years”)
- Author’s details
- Option to “Explore more from this person”

---

## Bonus: Cross-Mode Interactions

Even in full-screen mode separation, you can **link** the two experiences:

- From the chat view: when you finish a memory → “📌 View on Timeline” button
- From the timeline: “💬 Ask about this story” opens AI chat with this memory preloaded
- From a memory: “↩ Back to [Person]’s Timeline” → jumps to the anchor date

---

## Summary

- A **Memory** is a rich, timestamped story made up of: title, narrative (text/audio), media, tags, and links to people/places.
- In a **full-screen layout**, each memory is shown as a clean, immersive "story view" – like a blog post with media and context.
- Accessing someone else's memories happens via:
  - their **profile or family tree node**
  - a **search query**
  - a **shared link**
- Navigation remains clean and focused: users are always *in* one mode – chat, timeline, or memory – never overwhelmed with both at once.
