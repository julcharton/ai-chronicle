# PostScrypt User Stories & Flows

This document outlines the key user stories and flows for the PostScrypt application, providing a comprehensive view of how users will interact with the platform across its various features.

## User Personas

Based on the project requirements, we have identified four primary personas:

1. **Memory Preserver (Storyteller)** - The individual recording their personal memories and life stories, typically an older adult.
2. **Digital Ancestor (AI Persona)** - The AI-generated representation of the Memory Preserver, based on their recorded memories and personality.
3. **Family Historian (Curator)** - The person responsible for organizing, verifying, and maintaining the family's memory archive.
4. **Future Descendant (Audience)** - Family members who will access and interact with the preserved memories, possibly after the Memory Preserver is gone.
