# **User Experience**  
**Personas**  
1. **Memory Preserver**: "I want my grandkids to know my real story, not just dates"  
2. **Family Historian**: "Need to gather Aunt Martha's stories before she's gone"  
3. **Future Descendant**: "What was Grandpa like at my age?"  

**Key User Flows**  
1. **Memory Creation Flow**:  
   - User selects "Create Memory" → New memory document + dedicated chat interface opens → AI asks about topic → User writes with AI guidance
2. **Memory Editing Flow**:  
   - User selects existing memory → Document opens with its dedicated chat → User edits text with floating menu → Adds images as needed
3. **AI-Guided Enhancement**:  
   - Within document's dedicated chat, user requests help → AI suggests approaches to develop the topic → User implements suggestions in document

**UI/UX Principles**  
- **Document-Centric**: Focus on the text document as the primary interface
- **1:1 Document-Chat Relationship**: Each memory document has its own dedicated chat for assistance
- **Seamless Integration**: Chat and document work together to create cohesive experience
- **Unobtrusive Assistance**: AI helps guide but never takes over the storytelling
- **Intuitive Editing**: Floating menu for formatting and media insertion

# **Technical Architecture**  
**System Components**  
1. **Frontend**: Next.js (App Router)  
2. **Document Interface**: Markdown editor with floating formatting menu
3. **AI Services**:  
   - GPT-4 Turbo (memory guidance)  
   - Contextual question generation
4. **Database**: PostgreSQL

**Critical Data Models**  
```typescript  
interface Document {  
  id: string;  
  title: string;
  content: string; // Markdown text with embedded images
  type: 'memory'; // Indicates this document is a memory
  userId: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
  chatId: string; // Reference to dedicated chat for this memory
}  

interface Chat {
  id: string;
  documentId: string; // 1:1 relationship with memory document
  messages: ChatMessage[];
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```  

**APIs**  
- `/documents?type=memory` (GET list of memory documents)
- `/documents/:id` (GET/PUT specific document)
- `/documents/:id/chat` (GET chat associated with this memory document)
- `/documents/:id/suggestions` (GET AI guidance for memory development)
- `/upload/image` (POST image and returns URL to embed in markdown)

# **Implementation Strategy**  
**1. Document Interface Adaptation**
- *Reuse*: Modify existing text artifact (artifacts/text/client.tsx)
- *Approach*: Extend the Editor component with:
  - Floating formatting menu
  - Image insertion capability
  - Markdown support maintained

**2. AI Guidance Customization**
- *Reuse*: Adapt server.ts for memory-focused prompting
- *Approach*: Create specialized prompts for:
  - Memory elicitation questions
  - Topic development suggestions
  - Never inventing or fabricating details

**3. Memory Management**
- *Implement*: Central list interface for memories
- *Approach*: Create new components for:
  - Memory list view
  - Memory creation flow
  - Memory editing experience

**4. Image Integration**
- *Implement*: Image upload and embedding
- *Approach*: Add functionality for:
  - Image upload via floating menu
  - Image positioning in document
  - Caption support

**5. Codebase Cleanup & Focus**
- *Goal*: Remove unnecessary artifacts and focus solely on memory functionality
- *Approach*: 
  - Remove any artifact types not related to memory documents
  - Streamline the document interface for memory-specific use
  - Eliminate unused components and features
  - Refactor chat interface to only support memory discussion

**6. Prompt Security & Boundaries**
- *Goal*: Ensure AI guidance stays focused only on memory capture
- *Approach*:
  - Implement strict system prompts that limit AI to memory discussions
  - Create memory-specific prompt templates for different scenarios
  - Add guardrails to prevent off-topic conversations
  - Include explicit instructions to never fabricate or invent memories
  - Set up content filtering to keep discussions appropriate and on-topic

# **Risks & Mitigations**  
| Risk | Mitigation |  
|------|------------|  
| AI suggests fictitious details | Strict system prompts forbidding fabrication + user review |  
| Document editor too complex | Progressive disclosure of formatting options + intuitive icons |  
| Memory organization becomes unwieldy | Simple list with basic filtering for MVP |  
| AI attempts to discuss non-memory topics | Implement prompt security measures + content filtering |
| Users confused by limited functionality | Clear onboarding explaining memory-focused nature of app |
